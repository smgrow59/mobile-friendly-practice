  <h3>About the Baker</h3>
  <p>Hello there! My name is Sydney, and I am very passionate about pet health. Working at a pet store, <br> I learned that food is everything when it comes to pets. Fresh ingredients and limited fillers can be a very large key <br> into how healthy your pet is, reducing vet visits, making coats healthier, and more! In an effort to make it easier for pet parents <br> of all kinds to give the best to their very best friend, I hand bake treats with all the best ingredients.</p>

  <h3>Meet the Taste Testers</h3>
  <p>These furry friends have helped me make sure dog and cat recipes are up to snuff! <br> Since I don't own any type of small animal at this time, that treat testing was outsourced to friends and family.</p>

  <h4>Pyrrha</h4>
  <p>The poster girl for a picky husky! She's the reason I started getting into dog health.</p>
